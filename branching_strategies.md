## Feature branching

Feature branching is a branching-strategy that revolves around making different branches of the main codebase for every new feature, so that the software developer(s) can work on the feature without interfering with other developers or the main codebase. By using feature branching, we can more easily avoid changing/overriding changes made to the main codebase, and we can avoid having broken code in the main branch, which is an advantage in regards to continous integration.
