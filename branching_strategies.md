Feature branching is a branching-strategy that revolves around making different branches of the main codebase so that the software developer(s) can work on a feature without interfering with other developers. By using feature branching, we can avoid changing/overriding changes made to the main codebase, and we can avoid having broken code in the main branch, which is an advantage in regards to continous integration.
